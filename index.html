                            <p>A school tool combines the features of emails and SMS in one single platform with more added school-oriented features and interactive functions. So when compared to traditional communication channels that provide school updates scattered across channels, a school tool unifies it as most of these functions are integrated into it. </p>
                            <p>Moreover, most of the features of a school tool are designed to meet the requirements and needs of a school in mind, giving it enhanced flexibility to manage and facilitate any needs or requirements the school may face during the communication process. Apart from that, all the activities and engagement can be monitored and controlled by the school authorities. In other words, a school tool enables the school administration to take full ownership of all the communication activities that happen inside the school. This way, the school can create a safe and secure school communication ecosystem for everyone in the school community.</p>

                              <p>The school tools allow location independence. So when parents need to have a conversation with the teachers or the school administrators, they connect with them instantly with the built-in chat facility, no matter where they are. When parents can get involved in conversations and talk freely with teachers, they feel more part of the school and this instant engagement brings more promising opportunities for schools and children.</p>

                              <p>Since school tools allow parents and teachers to interact from anywhere to discuss school activities, share feedback, and resolve issues, the school can implement the ideas and inputs of parents in the classroom, thereby providing children with a better classroom environment that brings out the potential in them.
